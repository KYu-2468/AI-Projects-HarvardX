# HarvardX Artificial Intelligence with Python: AI/ML Projects

Welcome to my repository of AI and machine learning projects developed as part of the HarvardX Artificial Intelligence with Python course. This collection showcases a variety of applications, from game-playing AIs to predictive models and image recognition systems.

## Projects Overview

1. **Minesweeper AI**

   - An AI that autonomously plays Minesweeper using logical inference and probability calculations.

2. **E-commerce Purchase Prediction**

   - An AI model predicting whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase, based on customer interaction data.

3. **Nim Game AI**

   - A reinforcement learning AI that teaches itself to play Nim, learning optimal strategies through self-play.

4. **Traffic Sign Recognition**

   - An AI that identifies which traffic sign appears in a photograph using convolutional neural networks.

5. **Web Page Ranking**

   - An AI that ranks web pages by importance, inspired by search engine algorithms like PageRank.

6. **Text Prediction with BERT**
   - An AI that predicts masked words in text sequences using the BERT model, showcasing natural language understanding.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HarvardX-AI-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
